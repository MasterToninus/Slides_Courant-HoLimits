## Overview

This repository contains the Beamer slides used for the presentation titled **"A Canonical Morphism between Twisted and Untwisted Higher Courant L∞ Algebras"**. The talk discusses:

- Canonical Lie ∞‑morphisms between twisted and untwisted higher Courant algebras  
- A general framework for constructing these morphisms in any degree `n`  
- The underlying homotopical and geometrical structures  
- A brief connection to observable Lie ∞‑algebras on pre‑n‑plectic manifolds (see [arXiv:2209.05836](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05836))
