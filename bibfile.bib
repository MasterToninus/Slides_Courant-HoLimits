Let D be a degree one derivation of M squaring to zero and sending L into itself, then Voronov's construction of higher derived brackets associates to D an L∞ structure on A[-1]. It is known, and it follows from the results of this paper, that the resulting L∞ algebra is a weak model for the homotopy fiber of the inclusion of differential graded Lie algebras i:(L, D, [\{dot operator\}, \{dot operator\}])→(M, D, [\{dot operator\}, \{dot operator\}]). We prove this fact using homotopical transfer of L∞ structures, in this way we also extend Voronov's construction when the assumption that A is abelian is dropped: the resulting formulas involve Bernoulli numbers. In the last section we consider some example and some further application.},

Here, by means of an explicit homotopy equivalence, we interpret this L ∞-algebra in terms of infinitesimal autoequivalences of higher prequantum bundles. By truncating the connection data on the prequantum bundle, we produce analogues of the (higher) Lie algebras of sections of the Atiyah Lie algebroid and of the Courant Lie 2-algebroid. We also exhibit the L ∞-cocycle that realizes the L ∞-algebra of local observables as a Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau-type L ∞-extension of the Hamiltonian vector fields. When restricted along a Lie algebra action, this yields Heisenberg-like L ∞-algebras such as the string Lie 2-algebra of a semisimple Lie algebra.},
